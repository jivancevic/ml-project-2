## Abstract
In this paper, we conduct a thorough comparison of three key deep learning models - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Residual Networks (ResNet), and Dense Convolutional Networks (DenseNet) - for image classification tasks, using the widely recognized CIFAR-10 dataset. We offer an in-depth analysis of existing research, detailing the pre-processing steps, model configurations, hyperparameter selection, and evaluation metrics used in our study. We also provide a comparative analysis of the performance of each model in terms of accuracy. Our results highlight varied performance across the models, indicating that while simpler models can achieve reasonable results, better performance generally demands more computational resources. Our study aims to deepen understanding and guide future research in the field of image classification algorithms.
